1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

- The remote-side client can recognize that it has been given the output in its entirety by looking for pre-established delimiters or markers, i.e., a newline or an exceptional byte string. Techniques like the use of fixed-size buffers, application-layer framing protocols for messages, or leveraging TCP's streaming nature with specific protocols like HTTP or FTP guarantee the reception of the message as a whole.

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

- A networked shell protocol can specify command boundaries using length-prefixing (specifying the message length) or delimiters (such as newline characters). In case it is not dealt with properly, the protocol can suffer from incomplete message reads, message fragmentation, or over-buffering, leading to data loss.

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

- Stateful protocols store session information or state between the client and server (e.g., TCP, HTTP using cookies). Stateless protocols do not store session information and treat every request as isolated (e.g., UDP, HTTP without cookies).

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

- UDP is used in applications where timeliness is of importance and occasional loss of packets is acceptable, such as video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP. Its lower overhead because it does not retransmit makes it suitable for time-sensitive communication where reliability can be handled at the application level.

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

- The operating system provides sockets as the abstraction for network communication. Sockets allow applications to receive and send data from a network, using protocols like TCP or UDP.
